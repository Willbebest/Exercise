This folder is about the lab I made when I was studying computer network. Labs comes from the Stanford Computer Networking Course (CS144). If you are studying CS144, please follow the requirements of the two professors: complete all homework alone. At the same time, I am very willing to learn and communicate with you, my email: aduil526@outlook.com
